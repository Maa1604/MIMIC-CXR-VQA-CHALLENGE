        <h2>Data Usage Policy</h2>

          compliance with the restrictions imposed by the original ethics
          approval and patient consent.
        </p>

        <p>
          Following the conclusion of the challenge, the training and validation
          data will remain publicly accessible. These datasets may be utilized
          within the research scope of the challenge and in subsequent
          research-related publications. However, commercial use of the training
          and validation data is prohibited. In cases where the intended use is
          ambiguous, participants accessing the data are requested to refrain
          from further distribution or utilization beyond the scope of this
          challenge.
        </p>

        <h2>Publication Policy</h2>

        <p>
          We are planning to submit a challenge paper including the analysis of
          the dataset and the results. Members of the top participating teams
          will be invited as co-authors. The invited teams will be announced
          after the challenge event and will depend on the number of
          participating teams.
        </p>

        <p>
          The challenge organizers determine the order of the authors in the
          joint challenge paper. The participating teams can publish their
          results separately but only after publication of the joint challenge
          paper (expected by end of 2026). If you have any queries about the
          publication policy, please contact us. Once the challenge paper from
          the organizing team is published, the participants should cite this
          challenge paper.
        </p>
